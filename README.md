# Model-Controller-Architecture

In this application I will use a MVC architecture to be able to delegate appropiate tasks to different parts of the applications. The MVC facilitate not only making the code more readable but also more condense and straight to the point.

# Quizzler-iOS-App

This application is a quiz to see how smart someone is!
This application consists of true and false questions. It also has a progress bar at the bottom indicating how many questions the user got right.
When you click on the right answer you the button will turn green, when you click on the wrong answer, the button will turn red.
Once you are done, it will display your score for 3 seconds and restart the quiz.
